# Programming Languages

- In order to give a computer instructions, we need a way to 'communicate' our intentions to it
- We do this using programming languages
  - C / C++
  - Rust
  - Assembly
  - **Java**

---

# What is Java?
- Java is an *Object Oriented* programming langauge that is both *compiled* and *interpreted*
    - **Object Oriented** - Based on the concept that 'everything' is an *object*
    - **Object** - An "entity" with well-defined behavior (stores data and actions)
- Was created 29 years ago in 1995 by the Oracle Corporation
  - Latest version release, Java SE 23, was released on September 17th, 2024

---

# How Does Java Run?
- A computer can only execute machine code (built into the computer processor)
- *Compiled* programming languages take a "human-readable" source code file and convert it to something a computer can run
- *Interpreted* programming languages run another piece of software called the *interpreter*, which runs the source code file without ever compiling it
- Java does both

<!--
  - Compiled languages can also do optimization
-->

---

# How Does Java Run?

- Oracle wanted Java to be "write once, run everywhere"
- They accomplished this by also creating the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
  - Effectively a program that acts like a processor
- Java is *compiled* to Java Bytecode
- Java Bytecode is then *interpreted* by the JVM
- There is a JVM for every kind of processor (much easier to make)

---

# A Very Small Example Program

```java
public class Hello {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Writes "Hello!" to the console
    System.out.println("Hello!");
  }
}
```

<br/>

#### Console Output:
```
Hello!
```

---
# Basics of a Java Program

- Every Java program must have _at least one_ class.
- Each class has a name and _should_ start with an uppercase letter
- In the previous code, the class name is <code class="inlineCode">Hello</code>

```java
public class Hello {
```

<!--
These are presenter's notes
-->


---
# The "main" class
- The "main" class should have a *method* with this exact *method signature*:
```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```
- This tells Java where our program should begin running
  - There can only be _one_ main method per program

--- 
# Java Comments
- Java supports "comments" -- messages you can leave in the code.
- Our example program contained a *line comment*:
```java
// Writes "Hello!" to the console
```
- The start of a line comment is indicated with two slashes (//) and spans the rest of the line
- A *block comment* can span many lines, and is all text contained between an (*/\**) and and (*\*/*)

---

# Both Kinds of Comments
```java
/*
  This is a block comment.
  It is mutiple lines!
*/


public class Hello {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello!"); // A line comment can come after a line of code!
  }
}
```

---

# Statements

- A *statement* is a line of code that is an "actual instruction" (actually does something (usually))
```java
System.out.println("Hello!");
```
- This statement uses the method <code class="inlineCode">System.out.println()</code> to display a *String literal*
  - **String literal** - A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes ("")
- Every statement in Java ends in a semicolon (;)
---
# Java Syntax
- Being a programming <u>**language**</u>, there is a grammar and syntax to follow, much like in English.
- If you do not follow the "rules" of the language, you will get a *compiler error*, and your program will not compile.
- Much like English, there are special characters that denote special things, similarly to how an exclaimation point at the end of a sentence expresses strong emotion.

# Java Special Characters

  td { 
    color: black;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 20pt;

| {} | Open and close braces |  - Form a "code block" | -->

<style scoped>

    margin: auto;
    display: block;
    scale: 1.5;
  }
</style>

# Java Syntax
- The compiler will catch syntax errors: missing semicolons, brackets, etc.
```java
public class NoSemicolon {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("no semicolon")
    }
}
```

---

# System.out.println()
- The statement <code class="inlineCode">System.out.println()</code> consists of three parts
  1. First calls the <code class="inlineCode">System</code> class
  2. Accesses the <code class="inlineCode">out</code> property (the "default" output "stream" of class <code class="inlineCode">PrintStream</code>)
  3. Then finally calls the <code class="inlineCode">println()</code> method.
- The <code class="inlineCode">println()</code> method writes data to the print stream (the console in this case) and starts a new line.

    margin: auto;
    display: block;
    scale: 1.3;
  }
</style>

# System.out.print()
- Since <code class="inlineCode">System.out</code> is just a PrintStream, we can look at the Java documentation (kind of like a manual) for other methods we might be able to use: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintStream.html

---
# System.out.print()
- This method writes the string to the console, and *does not* start a new line.
- This allows you to break up a long string if you want, or to write to the same line later.

---

# System.out.print()
```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.print("Hello ");
    System.out.println("Everyone!");
  }
}
```

#### Console Output:
```
Hello Everyone!
```

# Code Formatting
- In Java, whitespace is ignored during compilation.
- As such, it is possible to write an entire program on a single line:
```java
public class Example{public static void main(String[] args){System.out.println("one line");}}
```
- However, this quickly becomes very difficult to read when any kind of complexity is used.
- As such, you should make use of whitespace to improve the readability of your code.
<!--
<code class="inlineCode"></code>
-->
---
# Code Formatting
- The earlier "block" format we used is much easier to read, and when we start writing our own methods, becomes practically the only real option if we want a readable class:

```java
public class ________ {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Statement 1
    // Statement 2
    // Statement 3
    // ...
  }
}
```

---

# Code Formatting
- There are two main styles when it comes to placing the opening bracket: **Next-Line** and **End-of-line**.

---

# Next-Line

```java
public class Example
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    System.out.println("Next-Line");
  }
}
```

---

# End-of-Line
```java
public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Next-Line");
  }
}
```

---

# Code Formatting
- There are two main styles when it comes to placing the bracket: **Next-Line** and **End-of-line**.
  - Note that the closing bracket is always on its own line ( it helps a lot with readability )
- While it is up to your personal preference, the wider Java community has adopted the End-of-line style.
