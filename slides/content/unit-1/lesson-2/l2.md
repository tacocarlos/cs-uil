# Types, Variables, And Arrays

---

# What Are Types?

- Types are a kind of "label" that you attach to variables so the programming language knows what operations are legal.
- There are three main "kinds" of types: primitive types, classes, and interfaces (which aren't covered in this slideshow)
- Java requires that the type of each variable and value be known at compile time, preventing a large class of errors


---

# Strongly Typed vs Weakly Typed

- There are two types of type systems for languages: **strongly typed** and **weakly typed**
    - Lack a formal definition
- **Strongly Typed Language** - Generally considered to be a language with strict *compile time* type rules that can't be avoided/sidestepped
- **Weakly Typed Language** - A language with weaker type rules that can be ignored.
    - C/C++, JavaScript, TypeScript

# Primitives vs Objects
- Primitives are data types that are very restricted in what they can do: store a single type of value
- Objects are the real type system of Java
    - Objects can store primitives and define methods, allowing for "real" functionality
- Primitive variables directly store the data, Object variables store a "pointer" to the data

# Primitive "Object Wrappers"
- Since Java is object oriented, there are times where Java needs an **object**, and won't accept a primitive type.
- Java provides some classes which essentially just "wrap" the primitive with object.
- Includes: `Integer`, `Double`, etc.

---

# Primitive "Object Wrappers"
- As a part of being an object, we can define attributes and methods.
- Gives us a way to "correctly" do things such as converting text to numbers and backwards
    - `Integer.toString(int x)` and `Integer.parseInt(String s)`
- Also gives us a way to access the maximum/minimum values of each type without having to know it.
    - `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE`

---

# Variables

- Variables are a way to assign a value to an identifier (name)
- All variables require a type to be assigned, and can be any of the three kinds of types.
- Variable names have some restrictions

---

# Variables
- Can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (don't use dollar signs)
- Names must begin with a letter (can also start with `$` and `_` but dont')
- Names are case-sensitive (`myVar` and `myvar` are two different variables)
- Cannot be a reserved word (Class name, keyword, others)

---

# Variables

- Variables are a way to assign a value to an identifier (name)
- All variables require a type to be assigned, and can be any of the three kinds of types.
- Variable names have some restrictions
- You don't have to **initalize** a variable when you create it
    - **initalize**: assign a value

---

# Creating variables

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // declaring variable but not initializing
    int x; 
    String s;
    List list;

    // declaring variable AND initializing
    int y = 11122024; 
    String s2 = Integer.toString(y);
    List list2 = new LinkedList<Integer>();
}
```
---

# What Is An Array?
- Now that we know how to store a single value, we might want to store many values.
- An array is a list stored in memory with each element (value) stored one after another.
    - For example, the first element might be at memory address `100`, the second at `101`, etc.
- Java provides two "arrays": the "primitive" array and the `ArrayList` class.

        font-size: 23pt;
    }

# Primitive Array Restrictions
- A primitive array is an array whose size is known at **compile time** and **cannot** be changed during runtime. 
    - Accessed with `<array-name>.length`
- A primitive array can store anything: primtives, Objects, and even other arrays.
- A primitive array will always have a default value, even if that default is `null`
- A primitive array will not "print" by default as it lacks a "conventional" `toString()` method.
    - Will always print `[` followed by a character that denotes the type of the array, then followed by the "identity hash code"
---


# Primitive Array Declaration & Instantiation
```java
int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int[] nums2 = new int[3]; // is the same as {0, 0, 0}
```

---

<style scoped>
    h1 {
        font-size: 45pt;
    }
</style>

# Primitive Array Access and Modification

```java
int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int[] nums2 = new int[3]; // is the same as {0, 0, 0}

int fourthValue = nums[3];
System.out.println(fourthValue); // prints the fourth element in `nums`, 4

nums2[0] = 6; // 

// you can ignore this next line for now
List<Integer> nums2List = Arrays.stream(nums2).boxed().collect(Collectors.toList())

System.out.println(nums2List); // "{6, 0, 0}"
```

---

# Iterating Through Arrays
- You can "iterate" (visit each element) through an array using a `for` loop.
    - Standard `for` loop: go from `0` up to the size of the array (for instance, `9` for `new int[10]`) and manually access each element using `arr[index]`
    - Enhanced `for` loop: iterate over the array and automatically get each value
- A standard `for` loop can be more powerful than an enhanced one
- The enhanced one is much more useful if you only care about the values (which is most of the time)


---

# Standard `for`
```java
int[] nums = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    int number = nums[i];
    // do stuff with number
}
```

---

# Enhanced `for`
```java
int[] nums = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
for(int number : nums) {
    // do stuff with number
}
```

# Intro to Methods - Static Methods
- Up until now, we have only used the "main" method:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {}
}
```

---

# Static Methods
- Static Methods are methods that can be called without needing a class instance (an initialized variable of that class) to function.
- Typically used as either utility functions or constructors (method that create a class).
- A static method can **only call other static methods**

---
# Static Methods

```java
public class Main {
    public int getNumber() { return 1; }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = Main.getNumber(); // THIS FAILS!!!
    }
}
```

---
# Static Methods

```java
public class Main {
    public static int getNumber() { return 1; }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = Main.getNumber(); // THIS WORKS!!!
    }
}
```
---

# Static Methods
- Static Methods are methods that can be called without needing a class instance (an initialized variable of that class) to function.
- Typically used as either utility functions or constructors (method that create a class).
- A static method can **only call other static methods**
    - An *instance* method (a non-static method) might rely on the object's data, which a static method doesn't have access to.

---

# Defining A Method
- A method is defined using the following format:
```java
public class ____ {
    [AccessLevel] [Static-ness] [ReturnType] [MethodName]([parameters]) {
        // ...
        return value; // where value is of the type [ReturnType] or no value if [ReturnType] is void
    }
}
```

---
# Defining A Method
- A method can be either `public`, `private`, or `protected`.
    - Only use `public` for now
- The "static-ness" of a method is determined by only if the keyword `static` is there.
- The return type can be any valid type or the `void` keyword
    - `void`: The method doesn't return a value
- A method can take any number of parameters, and any valid type (primitives, arrays, and objects)

    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = { 0, 1, 3, 4,
            5 // everything doesn't have to be on the same line
        };

        System.out.println(computeSum(numbers)); // prints "13"
    }
}
```
