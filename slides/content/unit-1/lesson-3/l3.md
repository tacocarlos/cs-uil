# Loops
---

# `for` Loops (non-enhanced)
- Useful for iterating over a range of values
    - E.g., from 0 to 100
- For arrays, very helpful when we care about the position of items and not just the value

---
# `for` Loop Syntax

```cpp
for(<expression>; <boolean-expression>; <expression>) {
    // code
}
```

---

# Going through the range $[0, 100)$

```java
int MAX_VALUE = 100;
for(int i = 0; i < MAX_VALUE; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

---

# Reversing an array
```java
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3 , 4, 5};
int len = arr.length;
for(int i = 0; i < len / 2; i++) {
    int firstIdx = i;
    int secondIdx = (len - 1) - i; // get end of array and then offset to opposite element
    int firstValue = arr[firstIdx];
    
    arr[firstIdx] = arr[secondIdx];
    arr[secondIdx] = firstValue;
}

// arr = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
```
---

# Some notes about `for` loops
- The `<expression>` can be an empty expression
    - `for(;;) {...}` is a valid `for` loop
- The `<boolean-expression>` is considered `true` when empty
- The `for` loop doesn't have to go through values sequentially
    - `for(int = 1; i < N; i = getRandomInt(0, N*2))` will run until `i` is randomly chosen to be at least `N`.

---

# `while` Loops
- Useful for running until a certain condition is reached

---

# `while` Loop Syntax
```cpp
while(<boolean-expression>) {
    // code
}
```

---

# Going through the range $[0, 100)$

```java
int MAX_VALUE = 100;
int i = 0;
while(i < MAX_VALUE) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

---

# Reversing an array
```java
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3 , 4, 5};
int len = arr.length;
int i = 0;
while(i < len / 2) {
    int firstIdx = i;
    int secondIdx = (len - 1) - i; // get end of array and then offset to opposite element
    int firstValue = arr[firstIdx];
    
    arr[firstIdx] = arr[secondIdx];
    arr[secondIdx] = firstValue;
    i++;
}
```
---

# A note about `while` loops
- Unlike `for` loops, the `<boolean-expression>` cannot be empty
---


# `do-while` Loops

- Useful for when you have a `while` loop whch you *know* will have to run at least once

---

# `do-while` Syntaxi
```cpp
do {
    // code
} while (<boolean-statement>);
```
---

# Going through the range $[0, 100)$

```java
int MAX_VALUE = 100;
int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
while(i < MAX_VALUE);
```

}

do {
    int firstIdx = i;

    int firstValue = arr[firstIdx];
    
    arr[firstIdx] = arr[secondIdx];
    arr[secondIdx] = firstValue;

# A Note on looping
- You likely noticed that each example is actually the same, just with a different looping mechanism
- While you can modify any loop into a different kind, there is generally a "correct" one to choose based on the task
    - Just because a screwdriver handle can be a hammer doesn't mean it should
    - The `do-while` loop usage isn't meant to really be used the way it was
- It is important to use the correct tool for the job

# Using `String[] args`
So far, the programs we have written have run in the console (such as PowerShell on Windows). When we compile and run a program, it looks like this (which online compilers and IDEs will hide away):
```bash
> javac Main.java
> java Main
```
---

<style scoped>
    img {
        padding-top: 50px;
        display: block;
        margin: auto;
    }
</style>

This is what it looks like if I run the "Average" example from last time:

# Using `String[] args`
Recall the function signature of the `main` method:
```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```
When we run the program with `java Main`, we can actually give provide more values which Java then passes to `String[] args`, which are separated on each space.
    - `java Main value-1 value 2` will pass `{"value-1" , "value", "2"}` to `String[] args`

---

# ArgEcho
```java
public class ArgEcho {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
        if(args.length == 0) {
            System.out.println("No Args!");
		} else {
		    for(String arg : args) {
				System.out.println(arg);
			}
		}
	}
}
```

# Prompting User Input
- `args` might be a convenient way of getting user input, but there isn't really any way for the user to know what arguments to pass before running it.
- There is a way for us to prompt the user to enter a String

    li {
        font-size: 26pt;

# `System.in`
- Recall that the `System` class has three public properties: `err`, `out`, and `in`.
- By default, is connected to the console
- The `in` property is an `InputStream`, which can read bytes (not Strings) from a source (not very useful by itself)
- Can **throw an Exception**, which makes it tricky to use (requires a "guard" to use)
- Will wait for the user to enter something into the console before continuing

---
# `System.in`
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
        int data = System.in.read(); // this line can throw an IOException
        System.out.println((char) data);
    } catch(Exception e) {
        System.err.println(e.toString());
    }
}
```
```zsh
> java Main
"laksjdflaskj" <-- user input
l
```

# The `Scanner` class
- The `Scanner` class is a class that, given an `InputStream` (such as `System.in`), can parse primitive types and Strings.
- Not limited to reading a single byte, can read entire lines and convert Strings to primitive types (such as `int` and `double`)
- It does the hard work for us, as it is still just reading bytes from the `InputStream`
- Requires to be **imported**, located in the `java.util` package
    - Place the line `import java.util.Scanner` at the top of a source file to use it in that file
- Since a `Scanner` can represent many different "source types" (like also files), it is considered a "warning" if `Scanner.close()` is not called on the object once you're done with it.
