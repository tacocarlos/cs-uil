# Basic Object Creation

---

# A Refresher on Objects

-   Objects are a "data type" that allows for functionality and data to live together
-   Can store `instance variables` and `methods`
    -   `instance variables` - variables that are tied to each object's **instance**
    - `methods` - a function that is within a class, Java does not support standalone functions
- Are the "core" data type of Java

---

# A Refresher on Objects

- Our only exposure so far to a "user written" class has been our "Main" class:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
}
```

---

# A Refresher on Objects

- So far, we have not really made use of what an object can do
- We <i>did</i> create a static method earlier, such as the `computeAverage` method earlier

---

```java
public class Average {

    public static double computeAverage(int[] nums) {
        double sum = 0.0;
        for(int number : nums) {
            sum += number;
        }

        return (sum / nums.length);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = { 0, 1, 3, 4 };

        System.out.println(computeAverage(numbers)); // prints "13"
    }
}
```

# Object Extension
- In OOP, objects can be built off the idea that you might want to "extend" certain functionality, and build things off of other things.

- For example, you might have a `Vehicle` object, but you could "extend" it to a `Sedan` object, and have specific functionality for `Sedan`s while still having it be compatible with code that wants a `Vehicle`.

---

# Interfaces
- Interfaces allow for us to specify a set of methods that a class must implement to **satisfy** an interface
- Essentially a "contract" between the user and an object that the object can do some things
- For example, rather than have a `Vehicle` root object and other types of cars "extending" it, each vehicle type could simply "implement" the interface
- Objects can implement many different interfaces

# The Java Type Hierarchy

- In Java, the root type of every object is the `Object` class.
- The `Object` class gives us a set of methods that are always available:
    - `Object.toString()` - returns the `String` representation of the object
    - `Object.hashCode()` - returns the "hash code" of the object (important for some things)
    - `Object.equals(Object obj)` - returns a boolean that indicates if the object "equals" another object
    - and more!
- As a result, any class we make will have access to these methods (although they might not behave how we want them to)


--- 

# `Integer`

- As an example, let's look at what the `Integer` class looks like:

---

```java
public final class Integer extends Number implements Comparable<Integer> {
    public Integer(int value) { ... }
    public Integer(String s) { ... }
    ...
    public static int max(int a, b) { ... }
    public static int parseInt(String s) { ... }
    ...
    public int compareTo(Integer anotherInteger) { ... }
    ...
    @Override
    public int hashCode() { ... }

    @Override
    public String toString() { ... }
    
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) { ... }


}
```
---

# `Integer`

- There are four different types of methods we just saw:
    1. Constructor
    2. Static Method
    3. Instance Method
    4. Overriding Method

---

# Constructors

- When we create an object, we have to use the following syntax:
```java
Object o = new Object();
```

- Constructors typically don't do "work". They simply set an object's data to a reasonable initial state.
- However, we can't always create an object without telling it some data first, since it might rely on that data to behave properly.
- Othertimes, we can use *defaults* to create the class.

---

# Default Constructor
- When we can create an object without needing additional data (or by using predefined defaults), we can implement a **default constructor**
- A default constructor takes no arguments, and looks like the previous example:

```java
Object o = new Object(); 
Car c = new Car();
```

---

# Constructors with arguments
- Constructors can take arguments in order to create the object:
```java
// Constructor: public Integer(int value) {...}
Integer number = new Integer(10);

// Constructor: public Integer(String s) {...}
Integer number2 = new Integer("2");
```

    li {
        font-size: 22pt;
    }
</style>

# Constructors with arguments

- When you call a constructor, Java will resolve which constructor to use based on the argument types
- However, this means you cannot have multiple constructors with the same input type
```java
public class MyInt {
    public MyInt(int number) { ... } // uses the value directly
    public MyInt(int numberToBeDoubled) { .. } // doubles the value, but would cause an compilation error!
}
```
- This kind of problem can be fixed with a static method that acts as a constructor

---

# Using a Static Method as a Constructor

```java
public class MyInt {
    public MyInt(int number) { ... }

    // no longer a constructor!
    public static MyInt DoubleValue(int number) { ... }
}
```
---

# Instance Variables
- Constructors are meant to simply get an object to a valid initial state
- Typically, this is where the object's  **instance variables** are initialized
    - **instance variable** - a variable that is tied to the *instance* of a class
- Objects usually operate on its instance variables rather than taking all of the data it needs at every method invocation (usage)

---

# MyInt

```java
public class MyInt {
    int data;

    public MyInt(int number) {
        this.data = number;
    }
}
```

---
<style scoped>
    li {
        font-size: 22pt;
    }
</style>

# `this`

- On the previous slide, you might have noticed that we prefixed accessing the `data` instance variable with the word `this`.
- When dealing with an object's instance variables, it is _sometimes_ optional to prefix it with `this` 
    - In the previous example, `this` was not required.
- Other times, it is _**not**_ optional. The instance variable's name is not a protected keyword.
- This causes a problem when it makes sense for a method argument or local variable (a variable that is declared in a method/scope) to have the same name as an instance variable 

---

# `this`

- When this kind of problem occurs, we can use the `this` keyword to refer to the **data the object  has** and not the other variable of the same name.
- I consider it to be good practice to always prefix instance variables with `this`, even when it is not required to make it clear that it is an instance variable.


---

# Name Collision

```java
public class MyInt {
    int number;
    public MyInt(int number) {
        // this is wrong; is re assigning the argument number to itself
        number = number; 
        
        // this is correct; this is assigning the argument number to the instance var
        this.number = number; 
    }
}
```

---

# A Reasonable Default

- Sometimes, a class might have a "reasonable default" - a value that "makes sense" for a variable to initially be
- In this case, you might have a constructor that requires less input (a default constructor) and "hard code" that value as the default

```java
public class IntButWithTwoAsDefault {
    int x;
    public IntButWithTwoAsDefault() {
        this.x = 2;
    }
}
```

---

# Static Methods
- Static methods are methods that act independently of an object instance
- Static methods do not have access to instance variables, as they are accessed through the class directly and not through an object (an instance of a class)
- Static methods will generally be either utility functions (such as `Math.sin(float x)`) or act as a constructor (but might do more work)

# Some Static Methods
```java
import java.io.File;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MyInt {
    int number;
    public MyInt() { this.number = 0; }
    public MyInt(int number) { this.number = number; }

    public static MyInt Add(MyInt a, MyInt b) {
        return new MyInt(a.number + b.number);
    }

    public static MyInt ReadFromFile(File file) {
        try {
            Scanner fileScanner = new Scanner(file);
            return new MyInt(fileScanner.nextInt());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println(e.toString());
        }

        return new MyInt();
    }
}
```
